/// This is a placeholder for the WebSocket endpoint documentation.

/// **IMPORTANT**: This endpoint uses WebSocket protocol, which is not fully supported by OpenAPI 3.0 generators.
/// Generated clients will only handle the HTTP upgrade handshake but will NOT provide WebSocket communication methods.
/// Clients must implement WebSocket handling manually.
///
/// **Protocol**:
/// 1. Client connects via WebSocket to `/v1/debug`
/// 2. Client sends a QuerySpecDto as a JSON text message
/// 3. Server streams back ResultEventDto objects as JSON text messages
/// 4. Connection remains open until client disconnects or query is terminated
///
/// **Note for Client Implementers**: You will need to use a WebSocket library directly for this endpoint.
/// The generated client code will not be sufficient for full functionality.
