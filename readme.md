# Drasi
Drasi is a platform that offers several unique benefits as a versatile and extendable solution for detecting changes across complex systems and responding to those changes in real-time. Drasi evaluates change data for relevance and produces always-accurate result sets that can be used to immediately trigger responses. It can even integrate data from multiple sources and evaluate changes from each of them against a single set of conditions. As a single solution that addresses the challenge of detecting changes and responding to them, Drasi eliminates complexity and and helps you proactively manage changes in dynamic systems.

## Overview
Drasi's design takes a novel approach to solving the problem of detecting releavant changes and reacting to them. Instead of constantly polling databases or collating related but siloed data into a large data lake, Drasi continuously watches for changes in specific data at the source. With full containerization and highly extendable points of integration, Drasi can quickly be seamlessly integrated into existing systems without disruption.
### Platform and Functionality Highlights
Drasi's rich query capabilities include:

•	Expansive coverage of the standard Cypher Query language and OpenCypher.

•	Dynamically combining data from multiple sources in a single graph query. You can even integrate data from relational and graph sources. 

•	Aggregation using count, sum, average, min, and max. These work across graph edges enabling queries that aggregate hierarchical data.

•	Access to historical values for query result nodes enabling queries to compare values over time and to aggregate series of values from time ranges.

•	Future functions  write Continuous Queries that react to the absence of change without the need to implement schedulers and timeouts.


Some of its platform highlights are:

•	Seamless integration with popular data repositories and platforms, providing flexibility and ease of use across diverse environment.

•	Full containerization; runs on a Kubernetes cluster. This cluster can be minimal for initial workloads, growing as needed.

•	Can be run on-premises or in the cloud.

•	Management via a CLI or API as well as integration with the Open Telemetry observability framework.

•	Visual Studio Code and browser-based tools to help developers write and test  Continuous Queries.

## Getting Started
Follow the [QuickStart tutorial]() and try out Drasi.

With Drasi, detecting and reacting to change is a simple three-step process:
1. Configure a Source representing the data source whose changes you want to observe.
2. Configure a Continuous Query to define all the data to observe, conditions to assess changes, and the structure of the output.
3. Configure a Reaction to take the output generated by one or more Continuous Queries and do something with it.
